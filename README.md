## 🧠 Project Overview
This project explores how blockchain can enhance internal audit integrity by providing tamper-proof, timestamped entries for financial systems. A Python simulation demonstrates how a basic blockchain can be used to store immutable audit records — ideal for detecting fraud and ensuring transparent financial control environments.

---

## 💼 Background
In traditional ERP systems, audit entries can be backdated or overwritten. This simulation shows how blockchain could prevent such overrides by chaining entries through secure hash functions.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Immutable blocks containing audit data
- Hash-linked chain to detect tampering
- Simple, beginner-friendly Python implementation

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `audit_blockchain.py` - Main Python script for creating the blockchain
- `README.md` - Project overview and context

---

## 📈 Sample Output
```
Block #0 | Timestamp: 2024-01-01 10:00 | Data: 'Audit Entry Initialized'
Block #1 | Timestamp: 2024-01-01 10:01 | Data: 'Journal Entry: 12345'
Block #2 | Timestamp: 2024-01-01 10:02 | Data: 'Approval by CFO'
```

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blockchain-audit-simulation.git
```
2. Navigate to the folder:
```
cd blockchain-audit-simulation
```
3. Run the script:
```
python audit_blockchain.py
```

---

## 🔗 Key Takeaways
- Hash changes indicate tampering
- Blockchain ensures financial entry transparency
- Enhances internal controls and reduces audit risk
